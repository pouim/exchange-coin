The test task is to showcase Currency Exchange Functionality using CRA (Create React App). 

Scenario - user has three wallets:

USD (initial balance $200)
EUR (initial balance €150)
GBP (initial balance £10)
  
Criteria:

Switch wallets e.g: EUR > GBP., GBP > USD., USD > EUR.
Enter the desired amount to exchange and has a CTA (call-to-action) to conclude the transaction.
Use this (https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/) or similar API to get the conversion rates.
Wallet balances are updated correctly.
Show an error message when the desired exchange amount exceeds the current balance.
 
Bonus points:

Nice friendly UI
Code quality
Unit Tests
 
Here is the video of just one implementation of this functionality. Now show us your creativity… We are looking forward to receiving the GitHub repo for code review!
